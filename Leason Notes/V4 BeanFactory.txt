             what and why spring ?
Spring is one of the most popular Java EE frameworks.
It is an open-source lightweight framework that allows Java EE developers to build simple,
reliable, and scalable enterprise applications. It provides Aspect-oriented programming.
It provides support for all generic and middleware services and mainly focuses on providing
various ways to help you manage your business objects.
It is a modularized framework where all the modules are designed on the concept called “Dependency Injection”.

Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the spring container to
‘inject’ objects into other objects or dependencies. In simple words,
the control of creating objects and managing the spring components is taken care of by the Spring containers.

               what is the difference between jar,war and ear?
jar ==> (java archive) java file with classes and resources like text ,images
war ==> (web application resource) it's file that is used to distribute a collection of jar files,
         jsp, servlet, xml, static web pages and other resources that constitute a web application
ear ==> (Enterprise application server) java ee file that packs one or more modules \
        into a single archive to deploy them on to an application server

    what is framework?
-- ال framework يعتبر هي اساسيات الابليكيشن عشان مابداش من الاول في البرنامج بتاعي
-- بتوفرلي سهوله في الكود وحاجات جاهزه كتير بجانب الكونفجراشن اللي هي مجهزاه
-- هي بتخليني اركز علي ال business logic
-- The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and
configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications

 Benefits of spring framework?
 1- POJO Based --> don't need application server to run. but you can use servlet container like tomcat
 2- Modular --> every part of spring can be used alone
                (spring data, spring mvc, spring core, spring security, .......)
 3- Integration with existing framework like Hibernate, jsp, jsf
 4- Testability
 5- spring mvc
 6- central exception handling
 7- lightweight --> project size is small
 8- transaction based

            what is IOC (Inversion of Control)?
 it's a design principle used to invert different kinds of controls in object oriented designed to
 achieve loose coupling
 control refer to any additional responsibility a class has, other than it's main responsibility

            what is IOC Container?
 is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the object. IOC get the information from XML File
 main tasks of IOC Container:
    - instantiate the application class
    - Configure the object
    - assemble the dependencies between the object

            type of IOC Container?
    - BeanFactory Container
    - ApplicationContext Container
