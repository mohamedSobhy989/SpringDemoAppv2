Dependency Injection..
Spring Configuration Type
    --> XML Based Configuration
    --> Annotation Based Configuration
    --> Java Based Configuration

what is bean --> bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled and managed by
                 Spring IOC container

what is the type of bean scope?
    ==> Singleton --> default of bean scope. container create one instance/object from this class
                      and every once we call this object by the same name the same object
                      will returned
    ==> prototype --> container will return different bean/object with every request
    ==> WEB Scope
        ==> Request --> different bean/object for every HTTP request
        ==> Session --> different bean/object for every HTTP session
        ==> Global Session --> one bean/object for Global/all HTTP session

what is Bean Life cycle?
    --> initialization bean
        --> when a bean is instantiate, it may be required to  perform some initialization
            to get it into a usable state <init>
        -->
    --> destroy bean
        --> when the bean is no longer required and is removed from the container
            Some cleanup may be required <destroy>

     --> if we need to perform init and destroy methods on class we implement two classes
            (InitializingBean, DisposableBean) and override two methods (afterPropertiesSet, destroy)

    --> but we can use it with injection with bean
        --> by using property init-method="methodName", destroy-method="methodName"
            --> methodName is a custom method declared on class

    --> There are 2 type of Dependency Injection
        --> Setter Injection
        --> Constructor argument Injection
